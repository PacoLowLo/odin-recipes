    <h1>Lemon Curd Italiano Semifreddo</h1>
    <h2><img src="../images/Three-Layer-Semifreddo.jpg"> "I think it's a cake, but a custard also?"</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4><ul>
        <li>7 egg yolks</li>
        <li>½ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li> 2 Tbsp lemon zest fresh</li>
        <li> 1 ¼ cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>¼ tsp salt</li>
        <li>¼ tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cup heavy cream chilled or premade whipped cream</li>
        <li> ¾ cup sliced toasted almonds</li>
    </ul></h4>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h4><ol>
        
        <li>Prepare a 9"-5" loaf pan by placing parchment paper in the bottom of the pan and a strip of parchment paper around the edges of the pan. Set aside. </li>
        <li>Add the egg yolks, sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest and salt to a small saucepan. Heat over medium low heat, whisking constantly until the mix begins to thicken. If you have a candy thermometer, place it in the mix as it cooks and stop when it reached 170 degrees F (this should take about 4 minutes).</li>
        <li>Remove the curd from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Strain through a fine mesh sieve and then add the curd to the bowl of an electric mixer. Beat the curd until cooled and very fluffy.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li>Fold the cooled curd into the whipped cream gently.</li>
        <li>Pour the lemon cream into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the top with the sliced almonds, pressing them gently onto the surface (this will be the semifreddo “crust”).</li>
        <li>Wrap the loaf pan completely with plastic wrap and freeze for at least 8 hours, overnight if possible.</li>
        <li>Once frozen, remove from the freezer, take out the plastic wrap and run a sharp knife around the edge of the loaf pan between the parchment and the pan. Flip the dessert onto a serving tray or plate.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve while cold!</li>
